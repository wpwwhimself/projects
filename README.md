# What am I looking at?

This is the code for the website http://projects.wpww.pl (or at least one of its versions; GitHub doesn't like me). It serves a dual purpose:

- showing the history of my music projects, both made for myself and for external clients,
- being the backend for my business of making karaoke tracks.
